### Hi, I'm Nick ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 20 y/o developer from Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­. Currently studying Computer Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich.

### ðŸŒŸ What I do and what tools I work with...
I'm a full-stack software developer, lately doing a lots of web development as a freelancer and working on smaller projects during my freetime.

For backend development, I use either Java or Node.js (JavaScript) to get the task done. For web development, my favorites are Next.js and TailwindCSS. You can also catch me writing iOS Apps using Swift and UIKit -- sometimes even messing around with SwiftUI.
